This is a python demo I used to understand the concepts of FFT, animation and how it all ties together

If you want to try it out, just add a wave file in this folder, rename it to 'sample.wav' and run 'main.py'

Dependencies:

    * pygame
    * pyaudio
    * numpy
    
Install dependencies with:

    pip install --user -r requirements.txt
    
Run:

    python main.py [/path/to/audio.wav]
